# Pickling and Exceptions in Python

## Introduction
In this assignment we are tasked with creating demonstration examples of error handling within Python and pickling data. The format of this assignment is different than previous assignments in that this week we are asked to create the examples and demonstrations ourselves. This is much more open ended than previous weeks and it was on us to decide what examples to use. This was a good method of learning as it requires us to go and research on our own about different ways to create the demonstrations. In the introduction video, the professor opens up that it’s on us to determine the number of examples and demonstrations. I chose to use 3 examples for this HW assignment.  

## Creating the Script
### 1.
The purpose of this program is to create examples of how Pickling and Exceptions work in Python. The format of this assignment is different than previous assignments in that this week we are asked to create the examples and demonstrations ourselves. This is much more open ended than previous weeks and it’s on us to decide what examples to use. (figure 1)
